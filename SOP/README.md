# My SOP Sample

The SOP I used in graduate school application. This one is used for CMU. Actually you only need to modify the last paragraph about POIs when applying for different universities.

**The SOP shouldn't be an extended version of CV.** You have all your research projects / publications / rewards listed in your CV, so here you need to say something different. Talk about what you learned from those experiences, how they form your current research interest and why you are the best choice for your POIs. The SOP may be read by someone not familiar with your field, so you don't need to talk about those technical details.

SOP_v1/2 are two versions of SOP containing comments on modifications. I think the comments are really really good. You can compare them with SOP_Final to see the difference.
