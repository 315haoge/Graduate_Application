# PhD Interviews

IF-Defense_7/30min.pptx are two versions of slides I used to introduce my projects. Different professors may ask you to introduce your research in different time limit (ranging from 7min-25min according to my experience). So I prepare a short and a long version of slides and interpolate between them adaptively.

Interview_Records.docx records some frequently asked questions in interviews, and my memoir of all the interviews I attended (written in Chinese).
