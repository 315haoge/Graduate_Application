# Professor List in CV
Currently looking for summer internship in Computer Vision area, so I make a list of professors that interest me.  
  
Professors are grouped by universities, sorted by [csranking](http://csrankings.org/). I mainly select professors who still work in universities for full-time, and still publish papers in last year.  
  
Info terms include:  
- University Name
- Professor Name
- Research Interest Area (concluded according to recent published papers by myself, so maybe inaccurate)
- Email Address
- Current Status (have position for summer intern or not, whether I think it's suitable to apply)
- Tips (additional information, like citation from Google Scholar, affiliated lab, some famous papers)
  
  
Hope this can help you in finding ideal summer intern / phd advisor. 頑張って!!!
