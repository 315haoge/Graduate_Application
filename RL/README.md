# Letter of Recommendation

This is a template RL I used for online application. Most professors in Chinese universities require students to write a sketch for them.

This is typically a research-oriented RL, including:

- Who is the recommender, how you know about the applicant
- His research experience in your group, your comment on his research ability
- Comment on other aspects of the student (teamwork, good at communication, etc.)
- Signature and titles. Note that some universities require scanned hand-written signature (e.g. Cornell CS 2021 Fall)
