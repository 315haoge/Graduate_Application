Self-funded Summer Internship Application - A Top 1% Undergraduate from Tsinghua University

Dear Professor XXX,

I am Ziyi Wu, a junior undergraduate from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University. I am writing to explore an opportunity of doing summer research at your renowned group (from July to September, about 10 weeks), for which I can fund myself.

I am very interested in your research on computer vision, especially XXX. And I believe that my current and past research experiences in relevant areas could well help me make meaningful contributions to your group.

I excel at academic study (GPA 3.91/4.0, ranking 2nd/173 in the department), with a strong background in mathematics and programming (graded 4.0/4.0 in all math and computer courses). I also have proficient skills in deep learning programming, with the experience of using Python and PyTorch.

Previously, I have conducted researches in deep learning and computer vision, authoring an article which is in submission to CVPR'20. In the paper, I proposed to apply the Information Bottleneck theory on binary detection networks (which is an extreme case of network quantization) and get competitive results on large-scale datasets like COCO. As I go further into my research, my interest in XXX increases. That is why I am particularly interested in your group.

My CV is in the attachment for your reference. Thank you very much for your reading and I am looking forward to your reply.

Best Regards,
